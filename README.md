[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up the integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=securemtr)

> Install the integration (via HACS or manual copy) before you use the ‚ÄúAdd integration‚Äù button.

## Who is this for?

For anyone using the **E7+ Wifi-enabled Smart Water Heater Controller** from Secure Meters. If you already manage your water heater with the Secure Controls mobile app and want the same control inside Home Assistant, this add-on is for you.

---

## What you can do in Home Assistant

- Turn the **primary** and **boost** immersion heaters on or off.
- Run the water heater during **off-peak rate hours**.
- Trigger a **boost** cycle for quick hot water when you need it.
- View daily energy use and total heating time for each heater.
- Create and adjust **weekly schedules** for both normal heating and boost periods.
- Use Home Assistant **automations**, **scenes**, and **voice assistants** to manage hot water.
- Add energy sensors to the **Energy Dashboard** to track costs over time.

---

## What you‚Äôll need

- A working E7+ controller connected to your Wifi with the Secure Controls app.
- Your Secure Controls account **email** and **password**.
- Home Assistant (Core, OS, or Container) with internet access.

---

## Install (step-by-step)

### Option A ‚Äî HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS ‚Üí Integrations** in Home Assistant.
2. Click **‚ãÆ** ‚Üí **Custom repositories** ‚Üí **Add**.
3. Paste `https://github.com/ha-securemtr/ha-securemtr` and pick **Integration**.
   Or click the badge above to fill this in automatically.
4. Search for **SecureMTR** in HACS and click **Download** / **Install**.
5. **Restart Home Assistant** when prompted.

### Option B ‚Äî Manual install

1. Download the latest release from GitHub.
2. Copy `custom_components/securemtr` into `<config>/custom_components/securemtr` on your Home Assistant system.
3. **Restart Home Assistant**.

---

## Set up the integration

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration** and search for **SecureMTR**, or use the badge above.
2. Sign in with the same **email** and **password** you use in the Secure Controls app.
3. Finish the setup. The water heater and boost controls appear as devices and entities you can add to dashboards or automations.

---

## Tips

- **Boost on demand:** Create a one-tap button in a dashboard to trigger a boost cycle before showers or laundry.
- **Schedule around tariffs:** Align the weekly heating timetable with your off-peak electricity rates for lower bills.
- **Energy tracking:** Add the energy sensors to Home Assistant‚Äôs Energy Dashboard to see usage trends and cost estimates.

---

## Timed boost controls

You now have four buttons in Home Assistant for quick boost actions:

- **Boost 30 minutes**
- **Boost 60 minutes**
- **Boost 120 minutes**
- **Cancel Boost** (only shown while a boost is running)

Tap a button on your dashboard, call it from the Services panel, or trigger it in an automation whenever you want hot water without opening the Secure Controls app.

## Timed boost sensors

Two new sensors help you see what the heater is doing:

- **Boost Active** shows if a boost is running right now.
- **Boost Ends** counts down to when the current boost will switch off.

Add them to a dashboard card or use them in automations‚Äîfor example, to skip starting another boost while one is already underway.
---

## Troubleshooting

- **Can‚Äôt sign in?** Double-check your details in the Secure Controls app first, then re-enter them here.
- **No devices appear?** Make sure the controller is online in the Secure Controls app and that your Home Assistant has internet access.
- **Need help?** Open a GitHub issue with your controller model and a short description of the problem. Do not share passwords or personal information.
